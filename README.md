# my react project 

word to create the first two pages in my project the log in page and the signup page. 
using the react-router-dom and createBrowserRouter i made routes between all my pages and a navigation bar that i use for setting up the pages. 
i also can use the same process to make individual buttons to the different pages. 
i am still working on the design and using the HCI principles to improve the layout and flow of my project.
